#   Real-Time Traffic Data Monitoring Pipeline (Databricks + PySpark)

## Project Overview and Objective

This project implements an **end-to-end real-time data pipeline** for traffic monitoring using **AWS, Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake**.

The pipeline processes **streaming traffic sensor data** and transforms it into analytics-ready datasets using the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

The final output enables **real-time traffic monitoring and smart city analytics** by generating key insights such as:

- Build a scalable real-time traffic monitoring pipeline to handle continuous data from sensors  
- Process high-volume streaming data using AWS Kinesis for near real-time ingestion  
- Store and transform data in Databricks Delta Lake using Medallion Architecture  
- Generate analytics for congestion detection, traffic patterns, and anomaly identification  
- Provide interactive dashboards to support real-time monitoring and decision-making

##   Dataset

### Dataset Source  
Simulated Traffic Sensor Data (Streaming via Amazon Kinesis)

The dataset represents real-time traffic data collected from sensors across city roads.

---

### Datasets Used

- Traffic Readings → Vehicle count, speed, congestion  
- Vehicle Metrics → Flow rate, density, delay  
- Speed Monitoring → Speed violations and variance  
- Incident Events → Accidents and disruptions  
- Signal Performance → Traffic signal efficiency  

These datasets simulate a **real-world smart city traffic system**.

##   Analytics Dashboards & Artifacts

*(Dashboard tool will be added here)*

### Dashboards

####   Congestion Hotspots Dashboard
Analyzes high traffic congestion areas across different locations.

####   Peak Traffic Hours Dashboard
Shows traffic patterns across different hours of the day.

####   Incident Monitoring Dashboard
Tracks accidents and disruptions across roads.

####   Traffic Signal Optimization Dashboard
Analyzes signal wait time and efficiency.

####   Traffic Delay Dashboard
Analyzes travel time trends and delays.

##   Business Insights Generated

The pipeline enables several **smart city traffic insights**:

### Traffic Trends
Identify peak hours and daily traffic patterns.

### Congestion Analysis
Detect high congestion zones and bottlenecks.

### Incident Monitoring
Identify accident-prone areas.

### Signal Optimization
Improve signal timings to reduce delays.

### Traffic Delay Analysis
Predict travel delays using historical patterns.

##   Data Quality Checks

Implemented checks include:

- Null value validation  
- Duplicate detection  
- Schema validation  
- Invalid data filtering  
- Streaming error handling  

### Monitoring

- Databricks logs  
- Streaming checkpoints  
- Error logging tables

##   Technologies Used

Python – Used for building data processing logic, scripting, and integration tasks across the pipeline

PySpark – Handles large-scale data transformations, cleaning, aggregations, and streaming processing in Databricks

Databricks – Core platform for data engineering; used for implementing Medallion Architecture and managing Delta Lake

AWS S3 – Serves as the data lake for storing raw (Bronze) and processed data in a scalable and cost-effective way

AWS Lambda – Enables serverless event-driven data ingestion and triggers streaming workflows

Amazon Kinesis – Handles real-time streaming ingestion of traffic data with high throughput and low latency

Amazon Firehose – Delivers streaming data from Kinesis to S3 after converting it into optimized formats like Parquet

AWS Glue – Used for metadata management, schema handling, and data cataloging

Apache Airflow – Orchestrates and schedules the pipeline workflows using DAGs and manages dependencies

Slack – Sends real-time alerts and notifications for pipeline failures and monitoring

Git & GitHub – Used for version control, code management, and collaboration across the project
